## Overview
We're baaaaaack! Running through **June 29**, Frontend Challenge: June Celebrations features our beloved CSS Art prompt and a brand new prompt: Perfect Landing.

Our theme is **June Celebrations**, designed to be all-encompassing and accessible as we celebrate everything from Father's Day to Juneteenth to Pride Month. There is so much worth celebrating this monthâ€”did you know June also hosts National Nail Polish Day, National Hazelnut Cake Day, and many more fun and quirky events?! We can't wait to see what you share with us.

As with all Frontend Challenges, there will be **one winner per prompt**. That's two chances to win bragging rights, a DEV++ membership, and an exclusive DEV badge!

## Prompts

### CSS Art: June Celebrations ðŸŽ¨
Draw what comes to mind for you when it comes to June celebrations. Consider this an opportunity to share something meaningful about your culture and community.

Whether it's Pride flags, a Father's Day card, Juneteenth commemoration, or even something wonderfully silly like National Donut Day! We want to see your artistic interpretation of a celebration in June.

### Perfect Landing: June Celebrations ðŸ›¬
Build a landing page that informs people about a June celebration that you care about. This could be anything from a comprehensive guide to Pride Month events, a tribute page for Juneteenth, or even a delightfully detailed breakdown of National Cheese Dayâ€”the choice is yours!

Your submission should be informative, engaging, and beautifully designed. While you may build fullstack applications, submissions will be judged purely on the frontend experience only. We're looking for accessibility, great user experience, creativity, and quality code.
