# CSS Art Submission Template

_This is a submission for [Frontend Challenge - June Celebrations, CSS Art: June Celebrations](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend-2025-06-04)._ 

## Inspiration
For me, switching from hot tea to iced tea is the definitive signal that spring and summer have arrived! I adore experimenting with fresh ingredients to create unique iced tea concoctions. With this CSS art project, I aimed to translate that personal delight into a visual celebration. My goal was to create a different iced tea art piece for each day of June, using a harmonious blend of tea-inspired colors and whimsical CSS art to embody the pure fun and vibrant spirit of the warmer months.

## Journey
My journey began with researching the many celebration days that June has to offer. Inspired by the variety, I used AI prompting to help brainstorm and generate 30 unique iced tea names and their ingredientsâ€”one for each day of the month. Next, I designed a custom color palette and font theme to give the homepage a fresh, inviting look. I then built the interactive grid for the 30 days, experimenting with several layouts and styles before settling on the final design. The most enjoyable part was creating the CSS art: I iterated through a few different approaches before landing on the playful, tea-inspired illustrations you see now. This project was a blend of research, creativity, and lots of experimentation, and I had a lot of fun bringing it all together!
